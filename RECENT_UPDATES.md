- Linked to job applications for context
- Real-time loading with JavaScript
- AJAX for marking messages as read
- Secure (users only see their own messages)

### UI/UX Improvements
- Consistent GT Navy + Gold color scheme
- Card-based layouts with subtle shadows
- Responsive design
- FontAwesome icons throughout
- Empty states for better UX
- Clear call-to-action buttons

4. Click "Send Reply" - done!
5. Recruiter receives your message instantly
